# TrafficFlowOptimization-MILP
Leveraging Mixed Integer Linear Programming to dynamically optimize speed limits and ramp metering rates, providing an intelligent solution for smoother traffic flow.

A detailed description of the real-time control methodology, optimization formulation, obtained results, and their interpretation can be found in my full paper on IEEE Transactions:\
**S. C. Vishnoi and C. G. Claudel, "Variable Speed Limit and Ramp Metering Control of Highway Networks Using Lax-Hopf Method: A Mixed Integer Linear Programming Approach," in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, vol. 23, no. 7, pp. 7441-7456, July 2022, doi: 10.1109/TITS.2021.3069971.**

This repository contains MATLAB scripts to program the traffic flow optimization problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and solve it using the CPLEX optimization solver.
